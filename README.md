This is the react js frontend for the CURD Api backend that I have develped using spring boot. By devoloping this I have learned the flow, how backend is connected to the fronted and also learned how API works.
I have also deployed both frontend and backend separatly and make a connection between then through which frontend can communicate with backend.
